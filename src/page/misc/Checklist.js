                    For completeness (and fun), here is the <a href="http://colinm.org/language_checklist.html">programming
                    language check list</a> for Flix:
                </p>

                <code>
                            <pre>{`You appear to be advocating a new:
[x] functional [x] imperative [ ] object-oriented [ ] procedural [ ] stack-based
[x] "multi-paradigm" [x] lazy [x] eager [x] statically-typed [ ] dynamically-typed
[x] pure [x] impure [ ] non-hygienic [ ] visual [ ] beginner-friendly
[ ] non-programmer-friendly [ ] completely incomprehensible
programming language. Your language will not work. Here is why it will not work.

You appear to believe that:
[x] Syntax is what makes programming difficult
[x] Garbage collection is free [x] Computers have infinite memory
[ ] Nobody really needs:
[ ] concurrency [ ] a REPL [ ] debugger support [ ] IDE support [ ] I/O
[x] to interact with code not written in your language
[ ] The entire world speaks 7-bit ASCII
[x] Scaling up to large software projects will be easy
[x] Convincing programmers to adopt a new language will be easy
[ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a language-specific IDE will be easy
[ ] Programmers love writing lots of boilerplate
[ ] Specifying behaviors as "undefined" means that programmers won't rely on them
[ ] "Spooky action at a distance" makes programming more fun

Unfortunately, your language (has/lacks):
[h] comprehensible syntax [h] semicolons [ ] significant whitespace [ ] macros
[ ] implicit type conversion [ ] explicit casting [h] type inference
[ ] goto [ ] exceptions [h] closures [h] tail recursion [ ] coroutines
[ ] reflection [ ] subtyping [ ] multiple inheritance [h] operator overloading
[h] algebraic datatypes [h] recursive types [h] polymorphic types
[ ] covariant array typing [h] monads [ ] dependent types
[h] infix operators [ ] nested comments [ ] multi-line strings [ ] regexes
[h] call-by-value [h] call-by-name [ ] call-by-reference [ ] call-cc

The following philosophical objections apply:
[ ] Programmers should not need to understand category theory to write "Hello, World!"
[ ] Programmers should not develop RSI from writing "Hello, World!"
[ ] The most significant program written in your language is its own compiler
[x] The most significant program written in your language isn't even its own compiler
[x] No language spec
[x] "The implementation is the spec"
[ ] The implementation is closed-source [ ] covered by patents [ ] not owned by you
[ ] Your type system is unsound [ ] Your language cannot be unambiguously parsed
[ ] a proof of same is attached
[ ] invoking this proof crashes the compiler
[ ] The name of your language makes it impossible to find on Google
[ ] Interpreted languages will never be as fast as C
[x] Compiled languages will never be "extensible"
[ ] Writing a compiler that understands English is AI-complete
[ ] Your language relies on an optimization which has never been shown possible
[ ] There are less than 100 programmers on Earth smart enough to use your language
[x] Hindley-Milner type inference takes exponential time

Your implementation has the following flaws:
[x] CPUs do not work that way
[x] RAM does not work that way
[ ] VMs do not work that way
[ ] Compilers do not work that way
[ ] Compilers cannot work that way
[x] Shift-reduce conflicts in parsing seem to be resolved using rand()
[ ] You require the compiler to be present at runtime
[x] You require the language runtime to be present at compile-time
[ ] Your compiler errors are completely inscrutable
[ ] Dangerous behavior is only a warning
[x] The compiler crashes if you look at it funny
[ ] The VM crashes if you look at it funny
[ ] You don't seem to understand basic optimization techniques
[ ] You don't seem to understand basic systems programming
[ ] You don't seem to understand pointers
[ ] You don't seem to understand functions

Additionally, your marketing has the following problems:
[h] Unsupported claims of increased productivity
[h] Unsupported claims of greater "ease of use"
[ ] Obviously rigged benchmarks
[ ] Graphics, simulation, or crypto benchmarks where your code just calls
handwritten assembly through your FFI
[ ] String-processing benchmarks where you just call PCRE
[ ] Matrix-math benchmarks where you just call BLAS
[ ] Noone really believes that your language is faster than:
[ ] assembly [ ] C [ ] FORTRAN [ ] Java [ ] Ruby [ ] Prolog
[ ] Rejection of orthodox programming-language theory without justification
[ ] Rejection of orthodox systems programming without justification
[ ] Rejection of orthodox algorithmic theory without justification
[ ] Rejection of basic computer science without justification

Taking the wider ecosystem into account, I would like to note that:
[x] Your complex sample code would be one line in: Haskell, Prolog, Scala, ...
[ ] We already have an unsafe imperative language
[ ] We already have a safe imperative OO language
[x] We already have a safe statically-typed eager functional language
[ ] You have reinvented Lisp but worse
[ ] You have reinvented Javascript but worse
[ ] You have reinvented Java but worse
[ ] You have reinvented C++ but worse
[ ] You have reinvented PHP but worse
[ ] You have reinvented PHP better, but that's still no justification
[ ] You have reinvented Brainfuck but non-ironically

In conclusion, this is what I think of you:
[x] You have some interesting ideas, but this won't fly.
[ ] This is a bad language, and you should feel bad for inventing it.
[ ] Programming in this language is an adequate punishment for inventing it.
